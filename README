Example of drawing LFS tracks, using d3.js and pth files
--------------------------------------------------------
Could be used for a "light-weight" live tracker.

I've provided my own converted pth files (in pth/), but also the rough code
to generate the json files from the original pths.

Known Issues:
  * Track doesn't match the same orientation as LFS
  * Doesn't take into account the actual track width - only uses the center
    coordinates

Requires:
  * d3.min.js
  * Any modern browser
